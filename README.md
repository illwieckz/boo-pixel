Boo89
=====

![Boo89](src/boo89.png)

This is a GreaseMonkey user script to display a pixelated _Boo_ with grey levels (like on a [TI 89](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series) calculator) instead of the default one on [yAronet](http://www.yaronet.com).

Installation
------------

Please install the [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon if you don't have it yet.

Once GreaseMonkey is installed, [click here](../../raw/master/src/boo89.user.js) to install the script.

Greetings

This script is dedicated to [Folco](https://github.com/Folcogh) <3
